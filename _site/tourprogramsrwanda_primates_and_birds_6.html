<p>6 Days Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Primates and Birdwatching Tour in Rwanda – PNV and Nyungwe</p>

<p>A 6 day safari, which starts and ends in Kigali.
The tour takes visits to Nyungwe, in South West of Rwanda, a huge afro-montane forest. With over 10000sq.km in size, Nyungwe is the undisputed giant in Central Africa. The natural forest is renowned for its large troops of colobus monkeys, chimpanzees, butterflies and a rich variety of orchids. Over 300 bird species have been recorded. Visit some cultural sites en route – the Museum in Butare and the palace at Nyanza.
Visit Parc National des Volcans (PNV) in the north of Rwanda where about 300 mountain gorillas live. You can track gorillas, climb the Visoke volcano, track the golden monkeys or visit the Karisoke Research Centre, which Dian Fossey the famous primatologist set up, or visit local villages.</p>

<p>DAY 1: Arrive at Kanombe ( Kigali) airport. Meet, greet and start for Nyungwe Forest National Park. Along the way, make stops at places of interest including local markets, the traditional palace of Rwanda’s Former King in Nyanza. Drive past green fields of tea scattered across the hillsides and the small wooden houses unique to the areas surrounding Nyungwe Forest. [Approximate driving time: 6 hours]
DAY 2: Guided nature walk in the forest to see a variety of animals and some of the three hundred bird species found here, which include the Rwenzori turaco and black and white casqued hornbill. Go on an escorted walk in search of large groups of colobus monkeys – sometimes as many as 400 in a group. OR go chimp tracking. Picnic lunch. Return late afternoon.
DAY 3: Return to Kigali. Along the way, in Butare, visit the Botanical Gardens and a cultural museum. Arrive Kigali City in time for lunch. Afterwards drive north to Kinigi via Ruhengeri. Enjoy the rolling hills for which Rwanda is well known.</p>

<p>DAY 4:Transfer to Kinigi Park Headquarters to track gorillas in Parc National des Volcans. Gorilla tracking through the forest, hills and swamps can be tough, arduous and tiring, sometimes taking up to 8 hours in the forest. But coming face to face with the great primates is well worth the effort.
Accommodation options available (all on full board basis)</p>

<p>DAY 5: Gorilla Trekking, Parc National des Volcans
Have breakfast and go to ORTPN offices for briefing after that set off in the forest for Gorilla trekking. A thrilling trek through the refined foothills of the Virungas provides inspiring views in all directions. Then, suddenly, the trail enters the national park, engrossing trekkers in the strange closeness of the rainforest, alive with the calls of colorful birds and chattering of the rare golden monkey, and besieged with fresh spoor of the mountains’ elusive populations of buffalo and elephant. Through gaps in the forest canopy, the marvelous peaks are sighted, easily easy to get to and among the uppermost in Africa, indicating an ascent. Gorilla trekking is quite strenuous but a worthwhile on encounter of these gentle giants. The enthusiasm of your coming across with these apes will wipe away your intricacy of the strenuous trek. Spend time watching gorillas, watch the adults feeding their young ones, brushing and resting as the youngsters play from vines in a pleasurably playful display.
Accommodation options available (all on full board basis)</p>

<p>DAY 6: Leave for Kigali. Time permitting; go for a tour of the city including shopping. Transfer to airport for your flight. [Approximate driving time: 3 hours].</p>

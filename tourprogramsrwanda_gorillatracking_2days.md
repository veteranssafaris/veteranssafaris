2 Days Rwanda Gorilla tracking tour
January 2, 2016 5 Comments	

This is a 2 day safari which starts and ends in Kigali- Rwanda. One gorilla permit for Parc Nationale des Volcanoes is included in the cost. Having a chance to see some of the last remaining 880 mountain gorillas in the world is a wonderful experience. It offers you an opportunity to track gorillas in Volcanoes National Park of Rwanda.

Day 1. Arrival and transfer to Kinigi/ Volcanoes National Park, home of Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda

Airport transfer with private vehicle and guide. Transfer to Volcanoes National Park with private vehicle and driver. Your guide will take you on a tour of the new and vibrant capital city of Kigali. The new prosperity features a number of thriving markets and features the mountain terrain famous in Rwanda. A sober contrast to its recent history. For survivors and others whose families were murdered in Rwanda´s genocide 1994, the Memorial sites and centres are places of dignified remembrance for loved ones lost. It is also a place of reflection and learning for the wider community, both in Rwanda and internationally.
Ranging in altitude from 2400km to 4,507 the Volcanoes National Park (French: Parc National des Volcans) is dominated by the setting of volcanoes after which it is named. Best known to the outside world as the place where for almost 20 years the American primatologist Dian Fossey under took her pioneering studies of mountain gorilla behavior. Day hikes to see the gorilla families can be strenuous on tracks climbing through the forest, and time is very limited once contact is made with the gorilla families. is a rare and memorable experience to visit with these giant cousins of man.
Our accommodation is ideally positioned for those who want to watch animals in their habitat, specifically the endangered Rwanda Mountain Gorillas that still roam these areas. Share in the cuisine of Rwanda, which is served with the hospitality for which we all return to African countries.
Accommodation options available (all on full board basis)
Up-market: Mountain Gorilla View Lodge
Moderate: The Garden House

Day 2. Gorilla Trekking, Parc National des Volcans

Have breakfast and go to RDB offices for briefing after that set off in the forest for Gorilla trekking. A thrilling trek through the refined foothills of the Virungas provides inspiring views in all directions. Then, suddenly, the trail enters the national park, engrossing trekkers in the strange closeness of the rainforest, alive with the calls of colorful birds and chattering of the rare golden monkey, and besieged with fresh spoor of the mountains’ elusive populations of buffalo and elephant. Through gaps in the forest canopy, the marvelous peaks are sighted, easily easy to get to and among the uppermost in Africa, indicating an ascent. Gorilla trekking is quite strenuous but a worthwhile on encounter of these gentle giants. The enthusiasm of your coming across with these apes will wipe away your intricacy of the strenuous trek. Spend time watching gorillas, watch the adults feeding their young ones, brushing and resting as the youngsters play from vines in a pleasurably playful display.

After drive back to the Hotel for lunch, drive back to Kigali and transfer at Airport for your flight.

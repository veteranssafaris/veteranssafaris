3 Days Nyiragongo Volcano Tour in Virunga NP

Day 1: Arrival In Kigali And Transfer To Goma in The Democratic Republique Of Congo, Night at Ihusi Hotel.

Day 2: Early Morning break fast and Transfer in the Centre Town for shopping then drive around 9am to the Nyiragongo Volcano trail head in Virunga National Park. The climb up Nyiragongo takes around five hours, is strenuous and often in hot and uncomfortable conditions, but the path is relatively easy and not excessively steep; there are also a lot of rare birds and small mammals along the trail and the view, when you reach the top, is stunning and other-worldly.

Again, it is important to have the right equipment in order to make the most of the hike. Equipments to bring: walking boots, a day back pack, light clothing, waterproof clothing, sun glasses, and clothes for the upper region of the volcano where you will spend the night and walking poles for hiking.

Nyiragongo Volcano is located in the east of DRC, around 19 km from Goma, and is the most active volcano in the world. In 1997 and 2002, flows of very liquid lava broke out from cracks in the volcanic slopes.Lakes of hot lava are one of the most spectacular forms of volcanic activity, but they are very difficult to see since there are only a few of them in the world at any given time. So, if you want to see a really impressive lava lake, you really only have one option left:
Nyiragongo.

The lava covered 17 km, reaching the town of Goma in just a few minutes, killing dozens of people, and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. The eruptions temporarily drained the lava lake in the summit crater and volcanic gases suffocated the heather forests on the upper slopes. But now the forest is recovering, and the wildlife is beginning to return. The night will be spent in tents on the rim of the giant crater, high above the active lava lake.

Day 3: An early breakfast and then begin your descent by 7 or 8 am.

Arrive at the trail head before lunch and transfer back to Rwanda border.
